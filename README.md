# Stock-Market-Predictor-V1

I created a simplistic Stock Market Prediction Model using Sci-kit learn and Keras Libaries to train my dataset and Matplotlib
to visualize it. I used an online Stock Market Dataset (last updated on 11/10/2017) to train and test my model's accuracy.

## The Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs)

The dataset consists of eight columns, ranging from the High-Low values for individual companies to the volume of shares
traded. For my model, I only used companies from the US stock market.

I graphed the closing stock value against their respective dates to help me better visualize the pattern (or lack thereof),
of the stock market from late 2005 to 2017.
